# 🎮 RPG Engine

<!--<SHORT-PRESENTATION>-->
A Modest Yet Overengineered RPG Engine

A browser-based RPG engine, built with **pure JavaScript, CSS & HTML**.  
No WebGL, no Canvas, just DOM magic.

## 🔹 Features (aka "What actually works")  

- 🎭 **2D RPG engine** → A fully functional tile-based world  
- ⚡ **Optimized Collision System** → Because walking through walls is cheating  
- 🤖 **Basic NPC System** → They exist, they stand around, they might even talk someday  
- 💾 **JSON-based map storage** → Save & reload maps like a pro

## 📌 Why This Exists (aka "I just wanted to test something, okay?")  

This project started as **a simple test**… and then I spent way too much time tweaking collisions.  

- **No external libraries** → Just pure JavaScript pain  
- **Runs entirely in the browser** → No setup, no dependencies, no WebGL  
- **Might be useful for something… someday**  

🛑 **WARNING:**  
- This is a **Proof of Concept** (POC).  
- Do **not** expect a fully functional RPG maker.  
- Some NPCs might judge you silently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- 🕸️ **Pure HTML/CSS/JS** → Because real devs suffer without frameworks  
- 🗂️ **JSON-based storage** → Maps & objects are fully modular  
- ⚡ **Optimized collision detection** → No more accidental wall-phasing  
- 🖌️ **Built-in Map Editor** → Because editing maps in raw JSON is barbaric  
- 🎨 **CSS-based rendering** → No Canvas, no WebGL, just clean DOM manipulation

## 📝 Future Improvements (or "Things I might add if I get bored")  

- 🚶‍♂️ **Better NPC AI** → Right now, they are glorified statues  
- 🏰 **More interactive elements** → Chests? Doors? Quests? Maybe  
- 🔥 **Event System** → Because RPGs need drama  
- 🏆 **Actual gameplay mechanics** → Walking around is fun, but let’s be real
